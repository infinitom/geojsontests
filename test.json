A representative or member of Parliament is elected for each electoral district. Following the release of population counts from each decennial census, the Chief Electoral Officer determines the number of seats in the House of Commons and publishes the information in the Canada Gazette. Electoral boundaries commissions then determine the adjustments to the constituency boundaries. The federal electoral boundaries commissions are independent bodies that make all decisions regarding the proposed and final federal electoral boundaries. Elections Canada provides support services to the boundaries commission in each province. Based on reports from these commissions, the Chief Electoral Officer prepares a representation order that describes the boundaries and specifies the name and the population of each FED. The representation order is in force on the first dissolution of Parliament that occurs at least seven months after its proclamation. The 2013 Representation Order (proclaimed on October 5, 2013) was based on 2011 Census population counts, and increased the number of FEDs to 338, up from 308 from the previous 2003 Representation Order. Ontario received fifteen additional seats, Alberta and British Columbia each gained six seats while Quebec added three seats. On June 19, 2014, the Riding Name Change Act, 2014 (Bill C-37) received Royal Assent changing the names of 31 FEDs. The names of FEDs may change at any time through an Act of Parliament.","categories":[{"type":"urn:gc:subject","terms":[{"term":"earth-sciences","label":"Earth sciences"},{"term":"cartography","label":"Cartography"},{"term":"geography","label":"Geography"},{"term":"geographic-data","label":"Geographic data"},{"term":"geographic-information-systems","label":"Geographic information systems"},{"term":"geomatics","label":"Geomatics"}]},{"type":"urn:iso:format","terms":[{"term":"shp","label":"SHP"},{"term":"gml","label":"GML"},{"term":"kml","label":"KML"},{"term":"pdf","label":"PDF"}]},{"type":"urn:iso:place","terms":[{"term":"canada","label":"Canada"},{"term":"ceonet","label":"CEONET"},{"term":"ca","label":"CA"}]},{"type":"urn:iso:series","terms":[{"term":"geobase-federal-electoral-districts","label":"GeoBase - Federal Electoral Districts"}]},{"type":"urn:iso:type","terms":[{"term":"data","label":"Data"}]}],"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-141.0,83.3],[-141.0,42.4],[-53.7,42.4],[-53.7,83.3],[-141.0,83.3]]]},"language":"eng; CAN","encoding":"utf8; utf8","publishedDate":"2015-10-01","updatedDate":"2016-02-17","editedDate":"2016-02-19","addedDate":"2016-01-07","citation":{"title":"GeoBase - Federal Electoral Districts - Canada 2015","alternateTitle":"FED","author":"Electoral Geography Division - Elections Canada","publicationDate":"2015-10","presentationForm":"mapDigital; carteNumérique","series":"GeoBase - Federal Electoral Districts","seriesIssue":"CA_2_2"},"browseImages":[],"licence":"© Department of Natural Resources Canada.
